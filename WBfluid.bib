  abstract = {Turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is not fully understood. It is known
	 that the flow of a simple, newtonian fluid is likely to be turbulent
	 when the Reynolds number is large (typically when the velocity is
	 high, the viscosity is low and the size of the tank is large). In
	 contrast, viscoelastic fluids such as solutions of flexible long-chain
	 polymers have nonlinear mechanical properties and therefore may be
	 expected to behave differently. Here we observe experimentally that the
	 flow of a sufficiently elastic polymer solution can become irregular
	 even at low velocity, high viscosity and in a small tank. The fluid
	 motion is excited in a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and
	 we observe an increase in the flow resistance by a factor of about
	 twenty. Although the Reynolds number may be arbitrarily low, the
	 observed flow has all the main features of developed turbulence. A
	 comparable state of turbulent flow for a newtonian fluid in a pipe would
	 have a Reynolds number as high as 105 (refs 1, 2). The low Reynolds
	 number or 'elastic' turbulence that we observe is accompanied by
	 significant stretching of the polymer molecules, resulting in an
	 increase in the elastic stresses of up to two orders of magnitude.},

	 initially grows exponentially in time, in agreement with theoretical

	 disturbance which causes this flow transition is nonaxisymmetric,
	 over- stable in time and subcritical in ${\dot \gamma}$. Spectral
	 analysis also show that the nonlinear flow which ultimately develops is
	 temporally aperiodic. These features of the flow transition do not
	 agree with the existing theoretical analysis. The experimentally
	 constructed flow- stability diagram shows that, for a given fluid, the
	 instability occurs at a critical Deborah number which is insensitive to the

  abstract = {This paper deals with the stability of incompressible inviscid planar
	 basic flows in a rotating frame. We give a sufficient condition for
	 such flows to undergo three-dimensional shortwave centrifugal-type
	 instabilities. This criterion reduces to the Bradshaw-Richardson
	 (1969) or Pedley (1969) criterion in the specific case of parallel
	 shear flows subject to rotation, to Rayleigh's centrifugal criterion
	 (1916) in the case of axisymmetric vortices in inertial frames, to the
	 Kloosterziel and van Heijst (1991) criterion in the case of axisymmetric
	 vortices subject to rotation and to Bayly's criterion (1988) in the case
	 of general two-dimensional flows in inertial frames. The criterion
	 states that a steady 2D basic flow subject to rotation is unstable if
	 there exists a streamline for which at each point 2(V/ + )(W + 2)<0
	 where W is the vorticity of the streamline, is the local algebraic
	 radius of curvature of the streamline and V is the local norm of the
	 velocity. If this condition is satisfied then the flow is unstable
	 according to the geometrical optics method introduced by Lifschitz and
	 Hameiri (1991), which consists in following wave packets along the flow
	 trajectories using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin formalism. When the
	 streamlines are closed, it is further shown that a localized unstable
	 normal mode can be constructed in the vicinity of a streamline. As an
	 application, this new criterion is used to study the centrifugal-type
	 instabilities in the Stuart vortices, which is a family of exact
	 solutions describing a row of periodic co-rotating eddies. For each
	 solution of that family and for each rotation parameter f = 2, we
	 give the unstable streamline interval, according to the criterion of
	 instability. This criterion gives only a sufficient condition of
	 centrifugal instability. The equations of the geometrical optics method are
	 therefore numerically solved to obtain the true centrifugally unstable
	 streamline intervals. It turns out that our criterion gives excellent
	 results for highly concentrated vortices, i.e., the two approaches
	 yield the same unstable streamline intervals. In less concentrated
	 vortices, some streamlines undergo centrifugal instability although our
	 criterion is not fulfilled. From these numerical results, another
	 criterion of centrifugal instability for a flow with closed streamlines
	 is conjectured which reduces to the change of sign of the absolute
	 vorticity W + 2 somewhere in the flow. ©2000 American Institute of Ph},

	 The simulations are carried out under fully^ turbulent conditions

	 experiments. In order to compensate for the lower Reynolds^ number,
	 we simulate more elastic fluids than the ones encountered^ in drag

	 heating. The onset time can be dramatically reduced at fixed Na by
	 increasing the centrifugal destabilization through the addition of
	 co-rotation of the outer cylinder. The onset time can also be reduced while
	 holding the centrifugal destabilization constant by increasing the
	 amount of viscous heating (i.e. holding Reynolds number Re constant
	 while increasing Na). The effects of viscous heating on the critical
	 conditions of Newtonian TC flows are also quantified using ramp tests

  abstract = {The effect of weak shear thinning on the stability of
	 the Taylor-Couette flow is explored for a Carreau-Bird fluid in the
	 narrow-gap limit. The Galerkin projection method is used to derive a
	 low-order dynamical system from the conservation of mass and momentum
	 equations. In comparison with the Newtonian system, the present equations
	 include additional nonlinear coupling in the velocity components
	 through the viscosity. It is found that the critical Taylor number,
	 corresponding to the loss of stability of the base (Couette) flow,
	 becomes lower as the shear-thinning effect increases. That is, shear
	 thinning tends to precipitate the onset of Taylor vortex flow. Similar
	 to Newtonian fluids, there is an exchange of stability between the
	 Couette and Taylor vortex flows, which coincides with the onset of
	 a supercritical bifurcation. However, unlike the Newtonian model,
	 the Taylor vortex cellular structure loses its stability in turn as
	 the Taylor number reaches a critical value. At this point, a Hopf
	 bifurcation emerges, which exists only for shear-thinning fluids.},

	 in the stability of three-dimensional boundary layers, the partial
	 differential equations governing small disturbances superimposed on the
	 basic flows are modeled by a simple system of ordinary differential
	 equations, which include a nondimensional parameter denoting magnitude
	 of the streamline curvature. The eigenvalue problem posed by the
	 model equations is numerically solved to evaluate effects of this
	 parameter on critical Reynolds numbers of the Falkner-Skan-Cooke
	 family of three-dimensional velocity profiles. Computational results
	 predict the possibility of a new instability, essentially due to
	 the streamline curvature, of the centrifugal type similar to the
	 Taylor-Gortler instability caused by a concave curvature of the wall.},
