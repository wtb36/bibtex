  abstract = {We study a stochastic
	 multiplicative process with reset events. It is shown that the model
	 develops a stationary power-law probability distribution for the
	 relevant variable, whose exponent depends on the model parameters.
	 Two qualitatively different regimes are observed, corresponding to
	 intermittent and regular behavior. In the boundary between them, the
	 mean value of the relevant variable is time independent, and the
	 exponent of the stationary distribution equals -2. The addition of
	 diffusion to the system modifies in a nontrivial way the profile of the
	 stationary distribution. Numerical and analytical results are presented.},
